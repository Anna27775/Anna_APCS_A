            <h1>About Berry</h1>
            <h3>August 23, 2018</h3>
            <p>Berry is a charming mix of Russian Blue and Persian, sporting the classic Tuxedo Cat look. He's always stylish with his tie and white "shoes" on all four paws. We adopted Berry from the Helen Woodward Animal Center right when he hit the two-month mark. Initially, his eyes were a soft grey, but as he's grown into an "adult" cat, they've transformed into a beautiful yellowish-green.

                Berry has a few favorite activities: savoring his treats and napping on the big grey sofa at home. He's quite sociable and loves interacting with people. You'll often find him seeking attention, either by following you around or affectionately brushing his face against your hand. Despite his adventurous spirit, he's terrified of the sound of a bouncing ball. This fear sends him hurrying back indoors whenever he encounters it.</p>
