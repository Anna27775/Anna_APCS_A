            <h1>Born in Seoul, South Korea</h1>
            <h3>July 5th, 2007</h3>
            <p>Anna is a 16-year-old student at The Webb Schools in Claremont. Originally from Seoul, South Korea, she moved to San Diego, California, in the 4th grade. After a unique drive-through graduation from Sycamore Ridge Elementary School; thanks to COVID, Anna spent two years back in Seoul, attending Dwight International School.

                With a growing passion for healthcare, Anna dreams of becoming a physician. Currently a sophomore, she has a love for all things matcha-flavored and spicy foods. Her interests include listening to artists like SZA, Drake, and Bruno Major, watching K-dramas, reading, enjoying Netflix documentaries, spending time with friends, and playing tennisâ€”a sport she's pursued since the 5th grade.

                Anna's perfect day would be: eating Malatang while binge-watching a K-drama series, and scrolling through TikTok.  </p>
